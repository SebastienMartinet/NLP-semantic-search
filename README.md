Designed and deployed a semantic search engine for astrophysics abstracts using TF-IDF, sentence transformers (BERT/SPECTER), and a hybrid relevance–impact ranking. Implemented explainability (term-level and sentence-level), clustering analysis, and interactive network visualizations in a Streamlit application.https://nlp-semantic-search.streamlit.app/ Designed and deployed a semantic search engine for astrophysics abstracts using TF-IDF, sentence transformers (BERT/SPECTER), and a hybrid relevance–impact ranking.
